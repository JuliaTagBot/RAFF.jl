RAFF - Robust Algebraic Fitting Function
========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fsobral/RAFF.jl.svg?token=AFD4xpyZzz3My5T6Sx1k&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fsobral/RAFF.jl)

This package implements a robust method to fit a given function
(described by its parameters) to input data. The method is based on
the LOVO algorithm and also in a suitable voting strategy in order
automatically eliminate outliers.
